# Sample Data for FAIR Data

Sample data retrieved from ["Interoperability and FAIRness through a novel combination of Web technologies"](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-110/). There is a sample github [repo](https://github.com/FAIRDataInitiative/DataFairPort) that has the original Perl code that generates the responses. Note that the IRI for [datafairport](http://datafairport.org) has expired thus "borking" the dereferencing of the IRI http://datafairport.org/ontology/FAIR-schema.owl. An old github copy is included in the data folder, however it is missing the #Projector entity referenced in the collection ttl files.  Most of the work has moved to the [DTL-FAIRData](https://github.com/DTL-FAIRData) github organization. This also includes metadata [validation](https://github.com/DTL-FAIRData/MetadataValidation) using ShEx. Code also ended up in the [FAIRDataInitiative](https://github.com/FAIRDataInitiative) github repository.
